        I am an engineering physics undergraduate passionate about Quantum
        Computing and Web Development. About two years ago, when I first
        discovered the field of Web Development and Quantum Computing, it
        totally amazed me and I have been dedicating my education to them ever
        since. Over the past two years, I have dedicated a considerable amount
        of time and effort to learning and developing skills in these fields by
        taking various online courses, reading different articles, making
        several projects, and involving in various research internships and
        mentorship programs. Fast forward to today, I am currently working as a
        Quantum Computing Intern at Creed & Bear and open-source contributor at
        the AsyncAPI Initiative.
