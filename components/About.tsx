        I am a UI/UX Designer passionate about transitioning into Web
        Development. My journey into web development began when I collaborated
        with web developers in my previous role, sparking my curiosity and
        interest in coding. Since then, I have been actively enhancing my skills
        by taking online courses, reading articles, working on personal
        projects, and gaining hands-on experience through internships. Fast
        forward to today, I am expanding my expertise in front-end and
        full-stack development, continuously learning and contributing to
        innovative projects.
